# Stored Product Insect Database (SPIDB) 

The Stored Product Insect Database (SPIDB) is the Python package to assist with the Stored Product Insect Database (SPID) available on Kaggle. 

Available on Kaggle:
- [Acoustic Stored Product Insect Dataset (A-SPID)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dkadyrov/stored-product-insect-database-spidb-aspids)
- [Microwave Stored Product Insect Dataset (M-SPID)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dkadyrov/stored-product-insect-database-spidb-mspids)

## Requirements 

I am guilty of using a lot of functions I personally developed and uploaded as the [DANKPY](https://github.com/dkadyrov/dankpy).

## Installation

Install directly from Git using Pip: 

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dkadyrov/dankpy
```

Locally install by downloading the repo and installing through pip after setting your terminal to the repo directory: 

```bash
pip install .
```
