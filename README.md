## Requirements 

I am guilty of using a lot of functions I personally developed and uploaded as the [DANKPY](https://github.com/dkadyrov/spidb). The requirements will install automatically during the pip installation through setupy.py. 

## Installation

Install directly from Git using Pip: 

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dkadyrov/spidb
```

Locally install by downloading the repo and installing through pip after setting your terminal to the repo directory: 

```bash
pip install .
```
