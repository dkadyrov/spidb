# Stored Product Insect Database

The Stored Product Insect Database (SPIDB) is the Python package to assist with the Stored Product Insect Dataset (SPID) available on Kaggle. The SPID dataset is a collection of recordings made using the Acoustic Stored Product Insect Detection System (A-SPIDS) and the Microwave Stored Product Insect Detection System (M-SPIDS) of several stored product insects at different life stages within various materials under different levels of artificial and natural noise.
